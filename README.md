# BeeBrilliant

BeeBrilliant is a prototype of an educational quiz web application. Users can take and create (create is currently only available via Postman or similar) customized quizzes on various subjects. Upon completion of a quiz, users receive instant feedback on their performance, including their score and any correct/incorrect answers. The app maintains a record of users' quiz history, enabling them to track their progress over time and identify areas for improvement. Users are rewarded with icon badges for reaching milestones, achieving high scores etc. and can view their progress\results on the user dashboard.

This app has been deployed to Azure and can be run locally on any dev environment that has the necessary prerequisites (.NET Core 7 etc. see below)
